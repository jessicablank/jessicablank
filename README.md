## Hello ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for visiting my GitHub Repo! <a><img align="right" src="https://github.com/jessicablank/jessicablank/blob/master/assets/OctoJessPlus.gif?raw=true"></a> 
 
<p> I am currently wrapping up a 12-week web-development coding bootcamp through UCSD extension to launch my STEM career. </p>
<p> The entire bootcamp took place over Zoom, GitHub, GitLab, Google Drive, and Slack due to the COVID-19 crises. </p>

### The bootcamp covered the fundamentals of:

:computer: Git, HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap & Materialize), Javascript, Web-API's, Third-Party API's, Progressive Web Apps, Server-Side API's, NodeJs, MySQL, express, Mongo, mongoose, and React. 

:wrench: Google Developer Tools,Postman, Testing with Jest, Visual Studio Code

### I am interested in coding and web-development because I am passionate about:
- :heavy_check_mark: critical thinking & problem solving
- :heavy_check_mark: lifelong learning
- :heavy_check_mark: reading & writing
- :heavy_check_mark: working on a team
