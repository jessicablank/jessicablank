## Thank you for visiting my GitHub Repo. 
### I am currently wrapping up a 12-week web-development coding bootcamp through UCSD extension to launch my STEM career  The entire bootcamp took place over Zoom, GitHub, GitLab, Google Drive, and Slack due to the COVID-19 crises. 
### The bootcamp covered the fundamentals of:
:computer: Git, HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap & Materialize) , Javascript, Web-API's, Third-Party API's, Server-Side API's, NodeJs, express, MySQL, Mongo and React. 

* I am interested in coding and web-development because I am passionate about:
- :heavy_check_mark: lifelong learning.
- :heavy_check_mark: reading & writing. 
- :heavy_check_mark: working on a team.
