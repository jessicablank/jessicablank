### Hello There ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jessica. Once we get to know each other, you can call me Jess 

### Thank you for visiting my GitHub Repo. 
### I am currently wrapping up a 12-week coding bootcamp through UCSD extension to launch my STEM career :rocket: The entire bootcamp took place over Zoom, GitHub, GitLab, Google Drive, and Slack due to the COVID-19 crises.

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my react porfolio and reading :books: Brandon Sanderson's _The Stormlight Archive_
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ALL THE CODING THINGS.
* ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Technical Writing! Once upon a time I earned a degree in editorial journalism from the University of Colorado at Boulder (_Go Buffs!_). My favorite professor told me data organization would be the key to my future and goodness! She is correct. Now I am hoping to become a software developer with a side-hustle in technical writing. 
* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help landing my first developer job. 
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about yoga, beer, or why I love playing a bard in 5th edition DnD.
